    description: "The first-generation Maruti Suzuki Celerio was introduced as a compact hatchback designed to combine affordability, efficiency, and practicality for urban Indian consumers. Notable for being the first car in India to offer an Automated Manual Transmission (AMT), marketed as Auto Gear Shift (AGS), providing the convenience of an automatic with the efficiency of a manual transmission at an accessible price point. Powered by a 1.0-liter K10B three-cylinder petrol engine producing approximately 67 horsepower and 90 Nm of torque, paired with either a 5-speed manual or the innovative 5-speed AMT. A CNG (Compressed Natural Gas) variant was also available in select markets for enhanced fuel economy. The exterior featured a conventional hatchback design with rounded edges and a short hood, optimized for urban maneuverability with its compact dimensions and tight turning radius. The interior was basic but functional, offering seating for five passengers with surprising interior space given its exterior dimensions. Available features (varying by market and trim) included power steering, air conditioning, power windows, central locking, and basic infotainment options. Safety equipment expanded throughout its production run to include dual front airbags, ABS with EBD, and rear parking sensors in response to evolving regulations. A minor facelift in 2017 brought styling updates including a revised grille, bumpers, and interior enhancements. The first-generation Celerio established itself as a practical, fuel-efficient city car, with its innovative AMT option helping to popularize automatic transmissions in the price-sensitive Indian small car segment."
